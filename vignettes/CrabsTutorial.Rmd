This R package is for processing crab data. The functions used are intended to better understand Maryland crabs and allow users to calculate a variety of data. Users should be able to clean their data, make a variety of different plots, as well as manipulate their data in some form or another. Alex Ferguson and Amber Peterson have been working on this R package together.
