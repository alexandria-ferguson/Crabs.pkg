In this tutorial we're going to use the crabs data set. 

```{R}
library(googlesheets4)
googlesheets4::gs4_deauth()
crabs <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aiM8BTWH26rimAvxx64GXLZypfCNgjEAz6r_R52Db90/edit?usp=sharing") 

```

This R package is for processing crab data. The functions used are intended to better understand Maryland crabs and allow users to calculate a variety of data. Users should be able to clean their data, make a variety of different plots, as well as manipulate their data in some form or another. Alex Ferguson and Amber Peterson have been working on this R package together.
